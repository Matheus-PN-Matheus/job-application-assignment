# Job Application Assignment – Booking Rates API

Hi there

This repository contains my submission for the Job Application Assignment 2.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how I can build a simple PHP-based REST API that connects to Gondwana Collection’s test API, transform input data, and return booking rates in a user‑friendly way.

What this project does
- Accepts booking details (unit name, arrival, departure, occupants, ages).
- Transforms the input into the format required by the Gondwana API.
- Sends the request and returns the response.
- Provides a simple **HTML + JavaScript frontend** so you can test it easily.

How to run it
1. Open this repository in GitHub Codespaces (no local setup needed).
2. Start a PHP server:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
---

NB: Personal Note
I started this project a little later than planned because I first had to secure a proper computer and a stable internet connection.  
While that delayed my start, it also reminded me that resourcefulness and persistence are part of the journey.  
I’m proud to have pushed through those challenges to deliver this assignment.
